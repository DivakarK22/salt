* Properly include a LICENSE file as per the Apache-2.0 license.

  on Linux, which could cause issues. Thanks go to Daniele Orlandi for the spot.
* Added specs to ensure that the FFI struct size matches the C struct size.
  This required adding mkmf-lite as a development dependency.
* Added a slightly more pessimistic version requirement for test-unit.

  to address the issue now resolved by the above change.
* Updated the cert again.

  for volume information.

* Added the percent_used, bytes_total, bytes_free and bytes_used methods
  to the Filesystem::Stat class. Thanks go to xanview for the suggestion.
* Changed File.exists? to File.exist? to avoid warnings in Ruby 2.1.x.

  instead of Fixnum.

* Minor updates to the gem:create and gem:install Rake tasks.

== 1.1.1 - 3-Oct-2013

  Thanks go to Jeff Shantz for the spot.

== 1.1.0 - 19-Jan-2013

  a single gem rather than separate gems for Windows and Unix.
